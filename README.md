Unity editor: 2021.3.5

If you open this project in the Unity editor and there are error logs indicating that you miss some components, make sure you import Addressables, OpenXR Plugin and XR Interaction Toolkit in your Unity Package Manager. In addition, make sure that your project uses Universal Render Pipeline(URP).

There is a built demo in  the Releases. It is a PCVR version and you have better use Meta Quest 2 to run it through Oculus Link because other VR headsets haven't been tested up to now.
